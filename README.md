# Scraping-Downloading-Bulk-Images
My Client give me a Project in which I have to Scrape and Download the Images of Famous People from this Website: https://www.famousbirthdays.com/  After Scarping I have to Convert every single Image into a 1 sec Video. Actually I have to write a Program that will do this task.   For Scraping and Downloading all the Images I Use Scrapy, OS Module, Requests, Pandas and for converting them into a 1 sec video (as soon as they download), I use Wand, FFmpy, Collections.  It was a long Journey and it was also not an easy task but You know I have Experience of 6+ Years in Python Scraping and all of the other Stuff it was not that hard for me but it was still a long Journey.  I Love to Work with my Client on this Project and Hopefully it was Successfully Done :)
